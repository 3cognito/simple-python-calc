## Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

### How to Play

1. The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10.
2. Enter your guess, and the game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
3. You have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
4. If you guess the correct number within the attempts, you win the game. Otherwise, the game will reveal the correct number.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x (The game uses type annotations, which are available in Python 3.5 and later).

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the 'guess.py' file from this repository.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the 'guess.py' file is located.

4. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```
   python guess.py
   ```

### Note

- I use type annotations to specify function return types (`Union[int, None]`) and parameter types (`int`). Type annotations are available in Python 3.5 and later.

- The initial code provided at the bottom of the file was a previous version of the game implementation. For clarity, it has been commented out.

Enjoy playing the Number Guessing Game! ðŸŽ²ðŸ¤žðŸŽ‰
