# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The game allows the player to play against the computer, where the computer's move is randomly generated. The player can choose either "rock," "paper," or "sci," and the game will determine the winner based on the choices.

### How to Play

1. Run the Python script (e.g., `rps.py`).

2. The game will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter your choice: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

3. Enter your choice by typing one of the options and press Enter.

4. The computer's choice will be randomly generated.

5. The game will announce the result, whether it's a tie, you win, or the computer wins.

6. After each round, the game will ask if you want to play again. If you type "y" and press Enter, a new round will begin. Otherwise, the game will end.

Enjoy playing the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer! 🪨 📃 ✂️
